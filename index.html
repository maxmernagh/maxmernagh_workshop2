Toronto was clear underdogs to win the Stanley Cup, but after upsetting the Chicago Blackhawks in Round 1 and the Montreal Canadians in the Finals in the 1967 NHL Playoffs, the Toronto Maple Leafs brought glory back to the city of Toronto for the 13th time, and the last time. In 2021, however, the Maple Leafs have all the ingredients necessary to bring glory back to the city of Toronto.</p>
